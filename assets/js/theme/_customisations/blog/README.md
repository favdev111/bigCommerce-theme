# Blog splitter

Blog splitter enables the ability to run multiple post types within the BC blog area and display them on different pages.
To enable this:

1. Uncomment the import and function within the `customisations.js` file.
2. Delete `blog.html` and rename `blog-splitter.html` to replace it.
3. Create landing pages for each post type and assign that page to the `post-list.html` custom page template.
4. Modify `post-list.html` accordingly to match the design required.
